## Next.js Textboard Application

### Overview

This application is a textboard-style platform currently under active development. It leverages the following technologies:

- **Authentication**: Clerk
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Schema Validation**: Zod
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Directory and Server Components

Despite its name, the application functions more like a traditional textboard.

### TODO List

- **Enhance UI**: Revamp the user interface to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
- **Implement Post Management Features**: Add functionality for editing and deleting posts.
- **Expand User Features**: Introduce additional functionalities for user management and interaction.
- **Write Tests**: Develop comprehensive tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application.
